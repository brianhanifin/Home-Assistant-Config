# The input_number component allows the user to define values that 
# can be controlled via the frontend and can be used within 
# conditions of automation. The frontend can display a slider, or 
# a numeric input box. Changes to the slider or numeric input box 
# generate state events. These state events can be utilized as 
# automation triggers as well.
