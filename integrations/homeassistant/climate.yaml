# The generic_thermostat climate platform is a thermostat implemented in Home Assistant.
# It uses a sensor and a switch connected to a heater or air conditioning under the hood.
# When in heater mode, if the measured temperature is cooler than the target temperature,
# the heater will be turned on and turned off when the required temperature is reached.
# When in air conditioning mode, if the measured temperature is hotter than the target
# temperature, the air conditioning will be turned on and turned off when required
# temperature is reached. One Generic Thermostat entity can only control one switch. If
# you need to activate two switches, one for a heater and one for an air conditioner,
# you will need two Generic Thermostat entities.
