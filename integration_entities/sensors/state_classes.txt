measurement
The state represents a measurement in present time, not a historical aggregation
such as statistics or a prediction of the future. Examples of what should be
classified measurement are: current temperature, humidify or electric power.
Examples of what should not be classified as measurement: Forecasted temperature
for tomorrow, yesterday's energy consumption or anything else that doesn't include
the current measurement. For supported sensors, statistics of hourly min, max and
average sensor readings is updated every 5 minutes.

total
The state represents a total amount that can both increase and decrease, e.g. a
net energy meter. Statistics of the accumulated growth or decline of the sensor's
value since it was first added is updated every 5 minutes. This state class
should not be used for sensors where the absolute value is interesting instead of
the accumulated growth or decline, for example remaining battery capacity or
CPU load; in such cases state class measurement should be used instead.

total_increasing
Similar to total, with the restriction that the state represents a monotonically
increasing positive total which periodically restarts counting from 0,
e.g. a daily amount of consumed gas, weekly water consumption or lifetime energy
consumption. Statistics of the accumulated growth of the sensor's value since it
was first added is updated every 5 minutes. A decreasing value is interpreted as
the start of a new meter cycle or the replacement of the meter.
